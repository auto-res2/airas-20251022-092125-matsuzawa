# Paper Outline
BOIL models the cost-sensitive black-box function, which maps hyperparameters and training iterations to performance, using a Gaussian Process (GP) with a product kernel. The training time cost is approximated by a linear regressor. The acquisition function is a modified Expected Improvement criterion, balancing exploration, exploitation, and computational cost. A novel training curve compression technique transforms the raw learning curve into a numeric utility score using a Sigmoid function, whose growth and middle point parameters are learned by maximizing the GP's log marginal likelihood. To prevent redundancy and ill-conditioning, BOIL selectively augments the training data by sampling points from the observed learning curve at maximum GP predictive uncertainty, adaptively controlling the number of samples based on the condition number of the covariance matrix.
